    Hello, I'm Perchant, a developer and a pentester from Slovakia. Welcome to my website! 
    My interest in hacking began at the young age of 13, leading me to explore extensively online. After a brief period with unhelpful tutorials, I moved on to learn Python and Linux myself, starting ambitiously with Gentoo. Despite initial setbacks, including multiple failed installations, I eventually transitioned to Arch Linux, then Ubuntu for its ease and speed, and finally settled on Kali Linux for penetration testing. Nowadays, I primarily use pure Arch for everything... Although I once favored Arch Linux as my main operating system, the convenience and minimal troubleshooting required with Windows have won me over, despite some privacy and security concerns, which can be fixed.
